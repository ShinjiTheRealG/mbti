		<h1>Personality Test</h1><br>
		<p><b>How to take this test:</b> There are many things to consider when taking this test, but the MOST IMPORTANT one is to make sure you consider each question with regards to
		how you compare to other people. Many questions are phrased as "You tend to" or "you often." It's important that it's not just often, but it's particularly often compared to others. 
		If the prompt is, "You often shower", don't think that showering once a day is often. You should consider what is particularly often compared to others since, arguably, the average person showers
		often. Please keep this in mind with each question as some prompts are applicable to a lot of people if not considered in this manner. When taking this test, also be incredibly honest with 
		yourself and think in broad terms and trends in your life. Also think about your natural inclinations or initial mental states, not the things that you WANT to be or will differently.
		It's important to consider that with willpower and self awareness, you can transcend your core self and act in any way you please. For example, if you tend to initiate conversations often
		because you decided that was best, that may be different from your core self. You may find it uncomfortable or unnatural to do these things, but you do them anyway.<br><br>
		<b>About this test:</b> This test is designed based on MBTI material from Myers-Briggs. It is, however, primarily focused on a Linda Berens/CSJ/John Beebe 8 function model.
		The test tries to decipher various elements of your cognitive function stack, usage of functions, attitude of functions, interaction styles, and temperaments. Keep in mind
		that this test is not a replacement for research on typology, thorough self analysis, or interview-based typing sessions. This test is primarily for fun! <br><br></p>

		Congratulations! You've finished the test. Below is a list of all 16 personality types with a numerical value assigned to each. The higher
		the number, the higher likelihood that you are that type. The lower the number, the lower the likelihood you are that type. Type descriptions may come in the future.
		The question about cats and the one about a palm tree have no influence on your results :) <br><br>
